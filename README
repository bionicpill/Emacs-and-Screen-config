INSTRUCTIONS:

These files should be dropped into your home directory if you don't have them
yet or you can append the contents of the files to the versions you have 
currently. I would recommend the latter.

TODO: 

Either break this up into a pure Screen/Emacs repo, or make it my standard
home directory for portability.
